It is assumed the user has some previous experience with ggplot2.\n\n\n\nslides recording repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting functions\n\n\nThis is also an art tutorial that introduces key programming concepts, and follows naturally from the ‘starting programming’ slides. It shows how to write functions and exposes the user to some of the purrr functionality.\n\n\n\nslides recording repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting R markdown\n\n\nAn introduction to R markdown.
